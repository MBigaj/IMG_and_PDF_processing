# IMG_and_PDF_processing
An app that processes Images and PDF files in a efficient way

Im trying to create a fast and easy to use QoL app that provides the user with simple yet necessary tools:
- Resizing images for when you just cannot attach that 10 Mb picture you took to an email you want to send
- Pesky pdf programs take hours to open up and then another to merge and or do anything with those files, that's why i added a merging tool

- Soon to be added:
PDF Auto watermark (for all pages)
More image related tools
Maaaybe more PDF usability via the app
